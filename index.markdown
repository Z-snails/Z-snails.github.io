# About me

I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Oxford.
My main interests are in programming languages, including (dependent) type theory and formal language theory.

# Talks

Here are the slides and additional material from some of the talks I've given.

- _Elaborating Dependent Type Theory_ presented during an internship at Aarhus University (TODO)
- _Context-Free languages: Expressionally_ presented for the Oxford Computing Society (TODO)
  - Supplementary material is available [here](/assets/mu-regular-expressions.pdf)
