# About me

I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Oxford.
My main interests are in programming languages, including type theory and formal language theory.

# Previous Work

- During the summer of 2025, I completed a research internship at Aarhus University supervised by Daniel Gratzer focusing on elaboration for [Multimodal Dependent Type Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15021).
The code is available [here](https://github.com/Z-snails/mitten_preorder/tree/zs-elaboration) and the (mostly complete) report is available [here](/assets/mtt-elaboration-report.pdf).

# Talks

- _Elaborating Dependent Type Theory_ --- an overview of the techniques used by type checkers for dependently typed languages to infer types and terms.
  Presented at the Aarhus University's Logic and Semantics group seminar ([slides](/assets/elab-dtt-slides.pdf))
- _Context-Free languages: Expressionally_ --- an introduction to $\mu$-regular expressions and fixed point theory.
  Presented for the Computing Society at Oxford University ([slides](/assets/cfl-expressionally.pdf), [supplementary material](/assets/mu-regular-expressions.pdf))
